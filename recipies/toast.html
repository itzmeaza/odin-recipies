    <ul>What you need:
        <li>A loaf of Wonderbread Toast for a dollar</li>
        <li>A stove</li>
        <li>Vegtable Oil (instead of butter, for comedy sakes</li>
        <li>A pan (because I'm a monster who expects you to make toast on the stove)</li>
        <li>(Please don't actually follow this recipie)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>How To:
        <li>Get your Wonderbread out, get 2 slices because that's standard.</li>
        <li>Put your pan on the stove and set it to medium heat</li>
        <li>Wait for the pan to get warm, then place the fluffy, bio-engineered bread onto the pan</li>
        <li>Wait for about 1 minute, then if you're with it, you don't need tongs or a spatula to flip it! Use your hands (disclaimer, please <em>don't</em>)</li>
        <li>Wait another min, then throw that hot sucker on a plate (throw it hard)</li>
        <li>Spread some good ol' crisco on that sucker. Lay it on THICK</li>
        <li>Eat and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
